# README

Learning Rails with the Hotwire stack, CableReady, and StimulusReflex with [this book](https://book.hotwiringrails.com/chapters). Github [repo](https://github.com/DavidColby/hotwired_ats_code).

```
docker-compose up
bin/rails db:create
bin/dev
```

## Chapter 1: Setup

Note project is using [Mrujs](https://mrujs.com/). Mrujs is intended as a direct replacement for `@rails/ujs`, which used to ship by default with Rails 6 but has since been deprecated.

## Chapter 2

### Devise

test1@example.com/123456

Add devise gem, with customizations to create `Account` model whenever a new `User` is registered.

```
bin/rails generate devise:views
bin/rails g devise User account:references first_name:string last_name:string
bin/rails g devise:controllers users -c=registrations
bin/rails g devise:controllers users -c=sessions
```

### Tailwind

Added a bunch of Tailwind stuff that isn't working, despite downgrading to same version as author's in `package.json`.

Had to comment out: `app/assets/stylesheets/forms.css`

Actually: Remove spaces between `hover` and `focus` and `:` fixes compilation errors.

### Stimulus

[Reference](https://stimulus.hotwired.dev/handbook/introduction)

[Regular Rails Flash Messages](https://www.rubyguides.com/2019/11/rails-flash-messages/)

> Stimulus is a JavaScript framework with modest ambitions. Unlike other front-end frameworks, Stimulus is designed to enhance static or server-rendered HTML—the “HTML you already have”—by connecting JavaScript objects to elements on the page using simple annotations.

Use Stimulus to display toast messages in the Rails `flash` hash.

See `app/javascript/controllers/alert_controller.js`. This gets connected to DOM in `app/views/shared/_flash.html.erb`

`<div data-controller="alert"...` tells Stimulus to instantiate a new instance of `AlertController` each time this HTML enters DOM.

`<button data-action="alert#close" ...` the [action](https://stimulus.hotwired.dev/reference/actions) attribute is how we trigger Stimulus methods based on user input. We can attach data-action attributes to any DOM element to listen for user interaction with the element as long as the element has a parent data-controller.

By default, Stimulus listens for `click` event for buttons. If wanted to listen for some other event such as `mouseup`:

```html
<button data-action="mouseup->alert#close">...</button>
```

Stimulus reference for [default events](https://stimulus.hotwired.dev/reference/actions#event-shorthand).

To get the flash partial `app/views/shared/_flash.html.erb` to render, update application layout `app/views/layouts/application.html.erb`:

```erb
<body>
  <div class="flex flex-col h-screen justify-between px-4 md:px-0">
    <main class="mb-auto w-full">
      <div class="mx-auto max-w-7xl">
        <%= yield %>
      </div>
    </main>
  </div>
  <div id="flash-container">
    <% flash.each do |key, value| %>
      <%= render "shared/flash", level: key, content: value %>
    <% end %>
  </div>
</body>
```

## Chapter 3: Job Postings

Standard Rails + [CableReady](https://cableready.stimulusreflex.com/) + a little Turbo Steams and Turbo Frames

> CableReady is a Ruby gem that lets you create great real-time user experiences by triggering client-side DOM changes, events and notifications over [ActionCable](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_cable_overview.html) web sockets. These commands are called operations.

A user of our ATS can create job postings that (later) applicants can apply to.

Use `scaffold` generator to create Job model, controller, and views:

```
rails g scaffold Job title:string status:string:index job_type:string:index location:string account:references
```

Use [ActionText](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_text_overview.html) to store job description rather than having longtext description column on jobs table directly.

```
rails action_text:install
bundle install
rails db:migrate
```

### Creating jobs in a slideover

Up until now, the jobs routes are all standard Rails. i.e. clicking on the new job link takes the user to a new page to fill out the job posting form. After they submit the form they are redirected to the job posting.

Goal: Open job form in a slideover drawer instead of navigating to a new page. When form submitted, newly created job should be added to the existing list of jobs and the slide over drawer should close.

Create new stimulus controller:

```
rails g stimulus slideover
```

Left just before `touch app/views/shared/_slideover.html.erb`
